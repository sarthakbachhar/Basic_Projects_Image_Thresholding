# Image Thresholding in OpenCV

This project demonstrates three image thresholding techniques: Binary, Adaptive Mean, and Adaptive Gaussian, using OpenCV and Matplotlib for visualization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Installation

Install the required libraries using pip:

    ```bash
        pip install opencv-python matplotlib numpy

## Usage

1. Update the image path in the script with the correct path to your image file.
2. Run the script to apply different thresholding methods and visualize the results side by side.
   
## Example

The script converts the image to grayscale and applies:

* Binary Thresholding
* Adaptive Mean Thresholding
* Adaptive Gaussian Thresholding

Results are displayed using matplotlib for comparison.
